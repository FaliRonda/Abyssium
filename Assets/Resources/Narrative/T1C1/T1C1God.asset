  dialogueText: 'So, you have finally arrived... I can not allow you to return their
    memories and uncover the truth.


    You might not remember me, but I know you
    and your purpose. Things are not as simple as they look... I won''t let you help

    but to use what little power I''ve managed to regain to stop you.
