  dialogueText: "You had to bring back her memories... of course you had... Now,
    it's too late. She will bring infinite pain to the world.\r\n\r\nI hope you've
    learned your lesson; you need to stay out of this, for everyone's sake. If you
    keep restoring their memories, you will eventually uncover your own identity,
    and that would be the end.\n\r\nI have been neglectful, but now that I have gathered
    more strength, I will ensure it does not happen again. I will send you to another
    timeline within this tower... one where you can't interfere with my plans anymore.\n\nEnd
    of the Demo, thank you for playing!\r\n\r\n[Press escape key / start button to
